After several years of blogging on Medium, I have made the decision to leave and start my own blog. I am fully aware that I will not receive the same level of views or exposure, but what I will have is complete ownership of my thoughts and writings.

There are a few factors that have led me to this. Firstly, I had to take a break from blogging because I started a new job and needed approval before I could resume. During this time off, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. Once I joined the Medium Partner Program, my writing became focused on how to increase reading time and interactions. Even before the partner program, my main focus was on getting published by Medium Publications, rather than writing what I truly wanted to write. This made me lose my passion for writing. There is nothing wrong with writing for a specific publication or aiming for viral content, but it simply isn't the type of writing I want to pursue.

So, what do I want to write about? I want to continue writing about the projects I am currently working on. Lately, I've been learning Common Lisp, a language that powers [the static site generator](https://github.com/oaguy1/cl-yassg) I developed to build this website.

Writing in Lisp has been both fulfilling and rewarding, despite its distinct syntax and problem-solving approaches. While I'm uncertain if I will ever write Lisp in a more serious manner than I currently do, learning it has been a pleasure and I intend to continue expanding my knowledge. I began by reading Paul Graham's 1995 classic *ANSI Common LISP*, and I am now delving into  *Let Over Lambda* to further explore programming macros. I am also contemplating learning other Lisp dialects, such as Racket or Guile, but that will depend on how focused I remain on my ongoing projects.

I will keep this first post brief. Going forward, my  blog will be hosted on GitHub Pages. Once I get final approval, I plan on acquiring a custom domain for this blog.
